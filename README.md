## Reinvent 2018 Social News App

Build a social news app.

Tools you will need:
- [Android Studio 3.2](https://developer.android.com/studio/)
  - Install an emulator for API level 28 *or* you may use a real device with Android Marshmallow and above
- [Node.js/npm v8+](https://nodejs.org)
- An AWS account

## Install AWS Amplify CLI

You will need the CLI to provision your backend resources.

```
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

After it has been installed configure it with your preferences.

```
amplify configure
```

Make sure that you save the access and secret key from the console and then input the access and secret keys when prompted by the sentence `Enter the access key of the newly created user:` on the terminal.

Sample input and output:

```
$ amplify configure
Follow these steps to set up access to your AWS account:

Sign in to your AWS administrator account:
https://console.aws.amazon.com/
Press Enter to continue

Specify the AWS Region
? region:  us-west-2
Specify the username of the new IAM user:
? user name:  amplify-Q1HYV
Complete the user creation using the AWS console
https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=undefined#/users$new?step=final&accessKey&userNames=amplify-Q1HYV&permissionType=policies&policies=arn:aws:iam::aws:policy%2FAdministratorAccess
Press Enter to continue

Enter the access key of the newly created user:
? accessKeyId:   ABC*****************
? secretAccessKey:  asdf*******************************
This would update/create the AWS Profile in your local machine
? Profile Name:  cli2

Successfully set up the new user.
```

## Clone the repository - CLI

Choose a directory to use a workspace. Once there, clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/reinvent-2018-social-news-app.git
```
There are two versions of the application in the repo. SocialNews, and SocialNews-complete. SocialNews-complete is a reference version in which all of the following steps have already been completed. The rest of this README will involve adding authentication, querying, and analytics to SocialNews.

Change your directory into the non-complete project.

```
cd reinvent-2018-social-news-app/SocialNews
```

## Open Project in Android Studio

Open Android Studio 3.2+. Go to the top bar and click **File** -> **Open**. In the pop-up, navigate to the location where you cloned the repo earlier. Select "SocialNews". Android Studio will then import the code and interpret it as an Android Project.

## Initialize your project - CLI

This will create an `amplify` folder within your project to keep track of the state of your backend as you add authentication, api, and analytics.

```
amplify init
```

Sample input and output:

```
$ amplify init
Note: It is recommended to run this command from the root of your app directory

## Add auth to your project - CLI

This will add Amazon Cognito Userpools and Amazon Cognito Identity pools to your project. Amazon Cognito Userpools will be used to keep track of your users and give them accounts with username and password. Amazon Cognito Identity pools will then give those accounts permissions to access AWS resources like the news articles.

```
amplify add auth
```

Sample input and output:

```
$ amplify add auth
Using service: Cognito, provided by: awscloudformation
 The current configured provider is Amazon Cognito. 
 Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? Yes, use the default configuration.
Successfully added resource cognito3da6ae94 locally
```

### Push the configuration to the cloud - CLI

```
amplify push
```

## Adding sign-in and sign-out code - Text Editor

Inside the MainActivity.java replace

```java
// TODO Add sign-in sign-out code
```

with

```java
if (AWSMobileClient.getInstance().isSignedIn()) {
    AWSMobileClient.getInstance().signOut();
    item.setTitle("Sign-in");
    // TODO Add analytics event for sign-out, this will be added at a later step
    break;
}

// TODO Add analytics event for sign-in, this will be added at a later step
AWSMobileClient.getInstance().showSignIn(this, new Callback<UserStateDetails>() {
    @Override
    public void onResult(UserStateDetails result) {
        item.setTitle("Sign-out");
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Exception e) {
        Log.e(TAG, "onError: ", e);
    }
});
```

## Add API (data) to your project - CLI

This will add AWS AppSync to front your data and Amazon DynamoDB as a data source to store your news articles and comments. The `model.graphql` file is provided in your project when prompted by `? Do you have an annotated GraphQL schema? Yes` and `? Provide your schema file path: ./model.graphql`.

```
amplify add api
```

Sample input and output:

```
$ amplify add api
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services GraphQL
? Provide API name: test123
? Choose an authorization type for the API API key
? Do you have an annotated GraphQL schema? Yes
? Provide your schema file path: ./model.graphql

GraphQL schema compiled successfully. Edit your schema at /Users/bimin/github/reinvent-2018-social-news-app/SocialNews/amplify/backend/api/test123/schema.graphql
Successfully added resource test123 locally
```

### Push the configuration to the cloud - CLI

```
amplify push
```

## Adding API (data) code - Text Editor
Inside NewsRepository.java add code to retrieve the list of news articles by replacing

```java
// TODO Add api (data) to list the news articles
```

with

```java
ListNewssQuery listNewssQuery = ListNewssQuery.builder().build();
client.query(listNewssQuery)
        .responseFetcher(AppSyncResponseFetchers.NETWORK_ONLY)
        .enqueue(new GraphQLCall.Callback<ListNewssQuery.Data>() {
            @Override
            public void onResponse(@Nonnull Response<ListNewssQuery.Data> response) {
                if (response.hasErrors()) {
                    Log.e(TAG, "onResponse: errors:" + response.errors());
                    return;
                }
                List<News> newsList = marshallListNews(response);
                newsDao.save(newsList);
            }

            @Override
            public void onFailure(@Nonnull ApolloException e) {
                Log.e(TAG, "Failed to refresh news item", e);
            }
        });
```

## Add analytics to your project - CLI

```
amplify add analytics
```

Sample input and output

```
$ amplify add analytics
Using service: Pinpoint, provided by: awscloudformation
? Provide your pinpoint resource name: 307r1
Adding analytics would add the Auth category to the project if not already added.
? Apps need authorization to send analytics events. Do you want to allow guests and unauthentic
ated users to send analytics events? (we recommend you allow this when getting started) true
Successfully added auth resource locally.
Successfully added resource 307r1 locally
```

### Push the configuration to the cloud - CLI

```
amplify push
```

### Adding analytics events - Text Editor

#### Sign-in event

Inside the MainActivity.java you can track sign-in events by replacing

```java
// TODO Add analytics event for sign-in
```

with

```java
ClientFactory.getAnalyticsClient().recordEvent(
        ClientFactory.getAnalyticsClient()
                .createEvent("ui")
                .withAttribute("clicked", "sign-in"));
```

#### Sign-out event

Inside the MainActivity.java you can track sign-out events by replacing

```java
// TODO Add analytics event for sign-out
```

with

```java
ClientFactory.getAnalyticsClient().recordEvent(
            ClientFactory.getAnalyticsClient()
                    .createEvent("ui")
                    .withAttribute("clicked", "sign-out"));
```

#### Viewed news event

Inside the DetailedActivity.java you can track which news articles are being looked at by replacing

```java
// TODO Add analytics to your app
```

with

```java
ClientFactory.getAnalyticsClient().recordEvent(
        ClientFactory.getAnalyticsClient().createEvent("ui").withAttribute("clicked", "newsId-" + newsId)
);
```

## Validating your configuration

### Building and Deploying through Android Studio

In order to deploy your application to a test environment, follow he [Android Studio Build/Deploy Instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/)

### Initial Sign-In

When you open the app for the first time, you will see a blank screen. This is because there is no data in your Amazon DynamoDB table.

In the upper-right hand corner there is a menu to upload sample data. After the upload, you should refresh the data, again in the upper-right hand corner and then the articles should show up.

### Viewing Analystics

Go to the AWS Console -> **Pinpoint**.
Within Pinpoint, expand the **Analytics** drop-down on the left and select **Events**

## Cleanup

From the root directory you've been working in, run

```
amplify delete
```
